## Reefwing MPU6x00

This is a fork of the [MPU6x00 Library](https://github.com/simondlevy/MPU6x00) by Simon D. Levy. It is a simple, header-only Arduino library for the InvenSense/TDK MPU6000 and MPU6500 inertial measurement units using
the SPI bus.  

It has been modified to use the [Reefwing imuTypes library header](https://github.com/Reefwing-Software/Reefwing-imuTypes) to make it compatible with the [Reefwing AHRS Library](https://github.com/Reefwing-Software/Reefwing-AHRS) and allow easy graphing of IMU values via the [Reefwing xIMU3](https://github.com/Reefwing-Software/Reefwing-xIMU3) data visualisation library.

You will need to install the Reefwing imuTypes library before using this library. This can be done via the Arduino IDE Library Manager or directly from the [Reefwing Software GitHub repository](https://github.com/Reefwing-Software).
